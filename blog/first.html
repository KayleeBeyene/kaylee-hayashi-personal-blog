          I’ve never really thought of myself as a writer. Actually, I’ve always
          claimed to be terrible at it. Writing, speaking, communication of any
          kind has always been difficult for me. Just as people tend to say they
          are just naturally bad at math, I used to say that I was just
          naturally bad at writing. I can see now that that line of reasoning is
          bollocks. Just like anything else we get taught in school, becoming
          good at writing takes practice. It happens that some individuals are
          naturally worse at it than others and some are naturally better. But
          really, after a certain level of competence, getting good at writing
          just takes practice. I am trying to start a career in television and
          radio so I need to learn how to communicate effectively. I need to
          learn how to speak even if I don’t think I have anything to say. And
          so I hope posting in this blog on a regular basis will help me to
          improve my writing skills. Thanks for reading and any feedback is
          welcome!
