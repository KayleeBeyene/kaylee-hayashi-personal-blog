      I’ve never really thought of myself as a writer. Actually, I’ve always
      claimed to be terrible at it. Writing, speaking, communication of any kind
      has always been difficult for me. Just as people tend to say they are just
      naturally bad at math, I used to say that I was just naturally bad at
      writing. I can see now that that line of reasoning is bollocks. Just like
      anything else we get taught in school, becoming good at writing takes
      practice. It happens that some individuals are naturally worse at it than
      others and some are naturally better. But really, after a certain level of
      competence, getting good at writing just takes practice. I am trying to
      start a career in television and radio so I need to learn how to
      communicate effectively. I need to learn how to speak even if I don’t
      think I have anything to say. And so I hope posting in this blog on a
      regular basis will help me to improve my writing skills. Thanks for
      reading and any feedback is welcome!
