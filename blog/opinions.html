        <p>
          I recently got back from at two day training retreat with my school’s
          students’ association. It was a great time. There was dancing,
          bonding, and other things stereotypically associated with college
          students. The better part of two days was spent with 13 other people
          and all we had for company was each other. It was really a great
          experience and I would recommend other students to run to be on their
          students’ association for opportunities like this. That being said,
          there was also a lot of training involved for the upcoming school
          year. We spent most of the first day learning about governance and
          strategy and what those two terms mean. We learnt the difference
          between high-level management and operational management and we even
          had a mock meeting just to practice Robert’s Rules of Order. It was
          all very informative, but there was quite a lot of information to
          learn in a short period of time. For many of the other students, the
          retreat was mostly a refresher( I’m a first year and most of the
          others are second and third years.) so I relied quite heavily on their
          guidance when we were doing practice case-studies. Often the final
          answers that we would give in these practice scenarios were the
          product of the other students and I just watched as they came up with
          the ideas and presented them. I didn’t feel confident enough that I
          knew exactly what the questions were really after in their answers and
          so I didn’t speak out when I thought the others were taking the
          answers in the wrong direction. Sometimes I was correct in mistrusting
          the answers that the others gave and sometimes not but I still never
          spoke out. That was fine for this training retreat but in the months
          to come I can’t let myself get into that sort of passive behaviour. I
          was elected into this position and so I have to speak up when I have
          opinions on things. A lot of times my opinions are contrary to what’s
          popular and so I often don’t speak them unless there is significant
          cause to do so. I don’t want to cause trouble or stir thing up but,
          generally, I do give thought to the things I say and if someone can
          provide sufficient reason as to why I am wrong about something, I have
          no problem conceding to their alternatives. In a Board of 15 Directors
          it can be hard to keep true to one’s own character, but it is
          necessary to keep in mind who you are, why you were elected, and what
          your values are. It can be hard to disagree with the people you were
          just partying with the night before but just remember that you don’t
          join a students’ association to party.
