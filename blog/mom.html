          My mom is a great lady. She has been through a lot. From heart bypass
          surgery to over 100lbs in weight loss, my mom has always been there
          for me. She came to all my sports games and has always supported me
          through whatever I have done. I love my mom and hope that she can, one
          day, see me doing something that she can be proud of even though I
          know she is already proud of me. Throughout the past couple of years
          my mom's health has not been very good but in that time I have seen
          her grow immensely. She has really come out of her shell and started
          to interact with people like she never used to. From going out to
          church and joining bible studies to getting brunch at Denny's, my mom
          has learnt to really interact and and connect with the people around
          her. I am so proud of her.
